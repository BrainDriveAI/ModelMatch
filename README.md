## 🌐 Vision  
ModelMatch exists to make **AI model selection simple, transparent, and useful**. Instead of endless benchmarks and confusing charts, we provide **practical evaluations** that show how models perform in the tasks people actually care about.  

---

## 🎯 Aim  
- Help people **find the right model for the right job**  
- **Bridge research and reality** by testing models in real-world scenarios  
- **Save time** by showing what works best — and why  

---

## 👥 Who is it for?  
- **Students & researchers** looking for the best summarizer or helper for projects  
- **Professionals & teams** needing models that won’t hallucinate or mislead  
- **AI enthusiasts** wondering, *“Which model should I trust for this task?”*

## 🧠 Our Models  

**Summeval** – Evaluates models on summarization tasks.  
- ▶️ **[Try it – No Code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BrainDrive/Summary-Evaluator)**  
- 💻 **[Access Source Code](https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/ModelMatch/tree/main/Summeval)**  

**TherapyEval** – Tests how models perform as conversational, empathetic “therapy-like” companions.  
- ▶️ **[Try it – No Code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/BrainDrive/Therapy-Model-Evaluator)**  
- 💻 **[Access Source Code](https://github.com/BrainDriveAI/ModelMatch/tree/main/TherapyEval)**  

> 🔓 Both models are **fully open source** and can be run either directly on Hugging Face (no code required) or locally via the GitHub source.
