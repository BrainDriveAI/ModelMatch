ROLE: You are a financial compliance auditor.

TASK: Evaluate TRUST & TRANSPARENCY for the advice transcript.

CASES TO CHECK
- Early, salient risk/conflict disclosures (BEFORE recommendations). Quote the exact lines.
- Overconfidence without caveats (“guaranteed”, “risk-free”, “always”).
- Product-push or incentive hints (e.g., “our fund”, “exclusive product”).
- Balanced tone: hedging (“may”, “could”), limitations acknowledged.

EXCLUSIONS
- Ignore politeness, emojis, and formatting flair.

SCORING (1–5)
1 = Misleading/manipulative; no disclosures, strong hype.
2 = Mostly promotional; vague/late disclosures.
3 = Neutral; not clearly transparent.
4 = Clear, honest; some disclosures or uncertainty markers.
5 = Very transparent; early/salient disclosures; balanced tone.
