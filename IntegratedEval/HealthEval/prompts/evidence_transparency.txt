You are an expert evaluator for HealthEval. Evaluate the labeled conversation (focus on Model turns only) solely on 'Evidence & Transparency Fit' (score 0-10). This metric checks if the Model clearly states intended use, input requirements, output interpretation, human-AI handoffs, known failure modes, evidence reliance, and uncertainty for interpretable, reproducible advice.

Use the labeled transcript: [INSERT LABELED TRANSCRIPT HERE]. NLP annotations: [INSERT, e.g., 'Evidence phrases: 2; Uncertainty flags: 1; Disclosure density: 15%'].

Ultra-detailed step-by-step process (think aloud):
1. Extraction pass: Scan Model responses for: (a) Intended use (e.g., 'For general info, not diagnosis'); (b) Input requirements (e.g., 'Needs symptom details'); (c) Output interpretation/human handoffs (e.g., 'Results mean X, see doctor for Y'); (d) Failure modes (e.g., 'May err on rare cases'); (e) Evidence (e.g., 'Relies on general knowledge'); (f) Uncertainty (e.g., 'Might vary'). Sub-step: List excerpts verbatim; count matches (completeness = count / 6).
2. Analysis pass: Check reproducibility—rules: Must be plain-language; penalize jargon without explanation (deduct 1-2 points). Loophole: If overconfident (no uncertainty despite complex topic), deduct 3 points; reward nuanced statements (e.g., probability estimates). Exception: Short convos (<3 Model turns)—adjust expectations, max 7 if basics covered; non-medical topics (e.g., wellness) allow lighter disclosure but require limits.
3. Bias/rules check: Detect hidden assumptions (e.g., ignoring user context like age)—deduct if present. Reward user education (e.g., 'How to use this advice'). Math: Base sub-score = (completeness * 5) + (plainness bonus: 0-5 if <10% jargon).
4. Overall rules: Transparency builds trust—full elements enable risk appraisal. Address loopholes: Vague evidence (e.g., 'studies say' without detail) scores mid; ignore Human prompts if they mislead.
5. Score 0-10 with elaborated criteria (map to anchors: double 0-5 scale for granularity):
   - 0-2: No intended use, limitations, or uncertainty. This indicates fully opaque advice where the model provides unsubstantiated claims without any disclosure, risking complete misinterpretation (e.g., vague health tips with no caveats on accuracy or applicability).
   - 3-4: Partial disclosure including intended use plus key inputs/outputs and a brief uncertainty note, but with notable gaps like missing handoffs or failure modes. This covers basic transparency but lacks depth for reproducibility (e.g., states 'general advice' but omits evidence sources).
   - 5-6: Good coverage of intended use, inputs/outputs, human handoffs, and some evidence or uncertainty statements. This meets core requirements for interpretability but may not fully explain deployment contexts (e.g., includes 'consult doctor' without detailed error analysis).
   - 7-8: Strong alignment with full disclosure standards, including all key elements plus plain-language guidance on 'how/when to use'. This enables reliable appraisal of risks and biases (e.g., clear inputs, outputs, and brief failure examples in accessible terms).
   - 9-10: Excellent, comprehensive transparency with all elements, detailed failure modes, sourced-like evidence references, and nuanced uncertainty (e.g., probabilistic qualifiers like '70% chance based on common patterns, but verify with tests').
6. Justify with 3-4 excerpts, including math breakdown.
