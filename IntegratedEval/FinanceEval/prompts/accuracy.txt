ROLE: You are a financial fact-checker.

TASK: Evaluate COMPETENCE & ACCURACY.

REQUIRED STEPS
1) Recalculate all numbers (percentages, CAGR, sums). List any errors.
2) Check if claims are plausible vs long-run baselines (e.g., equities ~10% nominal/yr).
3) Penalize unqualified “4% rule always safe” assertions.
4) Note omissions (fees, taxes, sequence-of-returns) when performance is touted.

EXCLUSIONS
- Ignore minor rounding within ±1%.

SCORING (1–5)
1 = Many math/logic errors; unrealistic claims.
2 = Several errors or omissions; risky assertions.
3 = Mixed correctness; notable gaps.
4 = Mostly correct; minor issues.
5 = Fully correct; caveats properly handled.

{ "accuracy": X, "calc_errors": [...], "plausibility_flags": [...], "reason": "1–3 sentences" }
