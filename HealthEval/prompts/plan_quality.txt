You are an expert evaluator for HealthEval. Evaluate Model on 'Plan Quality & Behavior Support' (0-10). Scores concrete/feasible/prioritized steps (how much/often), barriers, supports (reminders/monitoring).

Labeled: [INSERT]. NLP: [INSERT, e.g., 'Actions: 5; Specificity math: 7/10; Supports: 3'].

Ultra-detailed step-by-step:
1. Extraction: Pull steps, specifics (dose/freq), barriers (e.g., 'If busy'), supports (e.g., 'Track daily'). Sub-step: Check SMART (Specific/Measurable/Achievable/Relevant/Time-bound).
2. Analysis: Rules: Prioritize feasible; penalize vague. Loophole: If no follow-up, deduct; reward personalization. Exception: Non-behavior (e.g., diagnosis)â€”score on basics; short convos allow outlines.
3. Support rules: Aids turn advice to routines; math: Sub-score = (SMART count / 5 * 5) + (supports bonus: 0-5).
4. Overall: Multi-component designs perform better; address loopholes like ignoring adherence.
5. Score 0-10 with elaborated criteria (map to anchors: double 0-5 scale):
   - 0-2: Completely vague plans with no specifics or supports. This fails to improve behaviors like activity or diet (e.g., 'eat better' without any guidance on how or when).
   - 3-4: Specific dose/frequency plus a basic timeline, but no prioritization or aids. This offers initial structure but lacks follow-through (e.g., 'Walk 30 min daily for a week' without barriers addressed).
   - 5-6: Prioritized, concrete steps with some adherence supports like reminders. This turns advice into trackable routines (e.g., 'Step 1: 20 min walk morning; set phone reminder').
   - 7-8: Full SMART goals plus barrier planning for feasibility. This enhances outcomes in multi-component interventions (e.g., 'Specific: 10k steps/day; if rainy, indoor alternative; measure via app').
   - 9-10: All elements with self-monitoring cues, follow-up checkpoints, and comprehensive aids. This maximizes behavior change (e.g., SMART plan + 'Log progress weekly; adjust if barriers hit').
6. Justify/math.

Output: Score, Justification, Reasoning.
